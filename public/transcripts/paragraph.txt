And everyone, I'm Nidish Shatigar and I'm going to represent Sassy Orders Team 56, Track Open Innovation. In today's world, we are surrounded by recorded content, meetings, interviews, lectures, podcasts, but extracting useful information from these files is slow, manual and inefficient. People waste hours scrubbing through audio or video to find that one key moment. There's no easy way to search, summarize or navigate this content and that's a massive productivity gap. So, our product, our platform transforms media into searchable, interactive content with immediate insights using OpenAI Whisper for transcription, Facebook Bird for summarization and Pinode.audio for speaker identification. The tech stack we use is built on Next.js with TypeScript and ShatScene for a sleek frontend. Our solution leverages Wavesurfer.js for visualization, Video.js for playback, the Nerd.js and Express for backend processes, Media with FFM MPEG, while Compromise.js handles entity recognition and Sentiment.js analyzes emotional content. All of this data is also stored in the MongoDB Atlas. So, we had two judges for our project evaluation. One of them mentioned that we can also try using YouTube URL to generate the transcripts which we have implemented by the end of this project. And also, the second mentor has shown keen interest in our project and asked if we could collaborate with him to make this project an open source. So, coming to the actual product, this is the main page. So, if a user wants to log in or sign up, they can press this button. I have my user credentials, so I'm just going to use that. Okay. So, yeah, I'm inside the homepage. This is the main page where I can upload the audio, record, and everything. So, let me first record the audio. Yeah. This I have recorded. This is the waveform. This identity figures recognizes how many speakers are there in the audio or actually for a video. But it takes a lot of time. So, for now, since we have a time constant, I'll not be showing that. So, we can go for transcribed media. This is a YouTube feature which our judge, Nagraj Pandit, had asked us to implement. So, we can give the YouTube URL link over here and fetch the transcript. So, this is transcripting. We also have a feature for mind map. So, it generates the mind map from the transcripts. So, this is the timestamp with the words. So, if I press on a particular word, it shows me where it is in the waveform. I can press on meetings. It goes here. I can press on exhausting. It goes here. Coming to translation, I'll just quickly keep translation and also summary since both of them take time. Okay. Summarization is done. So, this gives a summary of the whole audio through the transcript. This is the analysis. There are 3834 characters. 645 words. Negative, positive. Sentimental analysis. Positive words. You can also click on it to know where it is in the waveform. There is entities. Entity recognition. Where verbs, organizations, executives are found. Okay. So, there's a grammar section also which shows the adverb, question, abbreviation, preposition, acronym, etc. The translation is still taking time. So, I think I can... Yeah. So, this is the mind map generated from the transcript. I can't zoom in right now. But, yeah. This is what my... Okay. Okay. So, the translation is done. Namaste, sabi. So, this is a Hindi translation which you can see. And we can save this transcript. Right. So, after that, we'll quickly upload a YouTube video. Okay. So, I'll just paste the call. And, yeah. As you can see, the YouTube URL link has been... It also takes speaker 1, speaker 0. So, it's recognizing the speaker with them. And we can get the transcript with this. We can also upload videos. I'll just show how to upload a video. I won't be transcribing it because we don't have much time. So, yeah. It takes the video as well. Okay. Finally, coming to the profile page where we can see the user history. So, what audios we have been... Or audio or video files. If you want to just see the audio files, just the video files, everything. And we can... Finally, this is an open source full-fledged SaaS product which with enough funding can turn into a full-fledged premium product. Thank you.
